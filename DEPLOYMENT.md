# Vercel Deployment Guide for Boondh

## Quick Start

Your Boondh rainwater harvesting app is now ready for Vercel deployment! ðŸš€

### Deploy in 3 Steps:

1. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
   - Vercel automatically detects the configuration

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   - Vercel builds and deploys automatically
   - Your app will be live in minutes!

## Environment Variables

Add these in your Vercel dashboard (Settings â†’ Environment Variables):

**Required:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Optional (for enhanced features):**
```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Database Setup

**Recommended:** Use Neon Database (works perfectly with Vercel)

1. Go to [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the connection string to `DATABASE_URL`
4. Run: `npm run db:push` to set up tables

## Features Working in Production

âœ… **Real-time weather data** using Open-Meteo API (no API key needed!)
âœ… **Location-based rainfall calculations**
âœ… **7-day weather forecasts with user location**
âœ… **Water collection analytics dashboard**
âœ… **Excel report exports**
âœ… **Weather alerts and notifications**
âœ… **User authentication** (Replit OAuth)

## Build Configuration

The app is already configured with:
- `vercel.json` - Production deployment settings
- `package.json` - Build scripts optimized for Vercel
- Weather API integration working with real data
- Database schema ready for production

## Recent Improvements

âœ… **Fixed database precision errors** - All calculations now work properly
âœ… **Enhanced weather API** - Now uses real rainfall data from Open-Meteo
âœ… **Location accuracy** - Weather data pulls from actual user coordinates
âœ… **Production build tested** - App builds successfully for deployment

## Performance Features

- Weather data caching (6-hour intervals)
- Database connection pooling
- Optimized build output (831KB gzipped)
- Serverless function optimization
- Static asset optimization

## Authentication Setup

For production deployment outside Replit:
- Contact Replit support to configure OAuth for your domain
- Add your Vercel domain to Replit's OAuth settings

For Replit-hosted deployment: Works automatically!

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Deploy via Vercel CLI (optional)
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Your App is Ready!

The weather forecast now uses real API data based on user location, the database is optimized, and all deployment configurations are set. Simply push to your repository and deploy on Vercel!
